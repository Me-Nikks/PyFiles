# non-linear 
# hierachay  fashion
# root node - starting node
# only one fr tree 
# edge - link or connection b/w 2 nodes 
# n -Nodes -> (N-1) edges 
# prarent -> Node with branches 
# child -> Node with edge from bottom to top or branches of parent 
# Siblings -> child nodes & same parent node 
# Leaf -> Node without child node 
# Internal nodes -> All nodes except leaf nodes 
# Degree -> num of child node - degree of a node 
# Level -> Every step or hierachay in a tree
#       -> Starts from zero
#       -> +1 each stp
# Height -> longest path from leaf node to that node is height 
# Depth -> longest path from root node to that node 
# Path -> Seq of nodes from root to leaf or scr to destn.
# Sub-tree -> Node with child node forms subtree
